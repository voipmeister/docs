## The env.php File

After install, an `env.php` file is generated. This file is important to guard and protect, as it will contain your phpvms settings. For any basic configurations, to avoid needing to change any files in the `/config` directory, the values are first read from the `env.php` file.

Any additions to this file will be noted in the `CHANGELOG` file.
