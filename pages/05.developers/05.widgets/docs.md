[TOC]

Widgets are little sections of code that can be included in a template, without having to modify the main controllers. Instead of building full-fledged add-ons, usually creating a widget will be good enough. A widget a "mini-module", can be placed in a template, as a single line. For example, the "latest pilots" or "latest pireps" are widgets.

If you want to display data differently, a widget is the best and easiest way to go.

Widgets are powered by the `laravel-widgets` library, which can be found [here](https://github.com/arrilot/laravel-widgets)
